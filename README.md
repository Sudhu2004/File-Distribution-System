# File-Distribution Tool - System Callers

**File-Distribution Tool** is a robust file-sharing system that supports multiple protocols, designed for efficient and reliable file distribution across networks. This project was developed as part of the Tally CodeBrewers 2024 Hackathon, where we secured 2nd runner-up under the theme "Wizard of System Programming."

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, each implementing file distribution using different protocols: `TCP`, `UDP_ACK`, and `UDP_no_ack`.

### 1. TCP

The `TCP` folder contains the implementation of the file-sharing system using the TCP protocol. This implementation ensures reliable transmission of files and folders between a sender (server) and one or more receivers (clients).

- **Main Components**:
  - **sender_gui.py**: Acts as the server-side application with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter. This is the sender program.
  - **receiver_ui.py**: The client-side application with a Tkinter interface. This is the receiver program.
  - **senderop.py, sender.py, Send_files.py**: These files implement the core logic for the sender, managing file selection, and transmission.
  - **receiverop.py, receiver.py, receiver_operations.py**: These files implement the core logic for the receiver, handling the reception and storage of the files.
  - **bandwidth.py**: Monitors and displays the network bandwidth utilized during file transfers.
  - **group_management.py**: Manages group creation, viewing, and deletion, as well as handling client requests to join groups. This script creates a pickle file to store group management data.

- **Usage**:
  1. Run `sender_gui.py` to start the server.
  2. Run `receiver_ui.py` on client machines to start receiving files.
  3. Monitor network bandwidth with `bandwidth.py`.
  4. Manage groups using `group_management.py`.

### 2. UDP_ACK

The `UDP_ACK` folder implements file transfer using the UDP protocol with acknowledgment mechanisms to ensure reliable delivery. The files are retransferred incase the ACK files are not received due to data packet loss.

- **Main Components**:
  - **senderop.py**: 
    - Create, view, and delete groups.
    - Add clients to groups and accept client requests to join groups.
    - Add files to the pending list for sending to a group.
  - **receiverop.py**: Handles the receiving end of the file transfer, ensuring that files are correctly acknowledged and received.

- **Usage**:
  1. Run `senderop.py` to manage groups and send files.
  2. Run `receiverop.py` on client machines to receive and acknowledge file transfers.

### 3. UDP_no_ack

The `UDP_no_ack` folder contains an implementation of file transfer using the UDP protocol without any acknowledgment mechanism, making it suitable for less reliable but faster transmission scenarios.

- **Main Components**:
  - **admin.py**: The admin-side script for sending files to clients.
  - **member.py (located in the Client folder)**: The client-side script for receiving files.

- **Usage**:
  1. Run `admin.py` to start sending files.
  2. Run `member.py` on client machines to receive files.


- **Multithreading**: Multithreading is utilized in all the 3 approaches to manage multiple clients and file transfers concurrently by creating new threads for each group.
- **Multicasting**: Multicasting has been used in the UDP file transfer methods, allowing files to be sent to multiple clients simultaneously, optimizing network usage.
  
## Group Management

Group management is a critical feature of this tool, allowing the sender to manage multiple clients and their access to files.

- **group_management.py (TCP folder)**: Manages group creation, viewing, and deletion, as well as handling client requests to join groups. This script creates a pickle file to store group management data. Separate threads for groups and threads for clients for transferring files areÂ simulataneosly created in case of TCP.

- **senderop.py (UDP_ACK)**: Provides functionalities for creating, viewing, and deleting groups, adding clients to groups, and managing file distribution to these groups. For each group a separate thread is run for sending files in sender and receving files in receiver in case of UDP.
and the multicasting takes care of sending the data to clients.

- **Functionalities provided for Sender**
  1. Create Group
  2. Delete Group
  3. Add Client to Group
  4. Remove Client from Group
  5. List Groups
  6. Add File to Pending List
  7. Send Pending Files
  8. View Pending Files Status
  9. View Join Requests
  10. Approve Join Request
  11. View Client Groups
  12. Check Active Receivers
  13. View Group Members
      
- **Functionalities provided for Receiver**
  1. Request and List Available Groups
  2. Join Group
  3. View My Groups
     
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library for GUI components
- `pickle` module for group management

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sudhu2004/File-Distribution-System.git
cd File-Distribution-System
```
## Running the Project

### For TCP-based file distribution:

1. Navigate to the `TCP` folder.
2. Run `sender_gui.py` on the server machine.
3. Run `receiver_ui.py` on the client machine(s).

### For UDP with acknowledgment:

1. Navigate to the `UDP_ACK` folder.
2. Run `senderop.py` to manage groups and send files.
3. Run `receiverop.py` on client machines to receive files.

### For UDP without acknowledgment:

1. Navigate to the `UDP_no_ack` folder.
2. Run `admin.py` to send files.
3. Run `member.py` from the `Client` folder to receive files.
